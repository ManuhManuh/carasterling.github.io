          <p class="lead">This is a VR experience, brought to you by VentR-out, that is meant to "Extend the Outdoors". It features orienteer racing with a map and compass, alone or as a team.</p>
          <p>I was originally contracted to take care of the backend stuff, specifically PlayFab and Azure.  I ended up doing that, and quite a bit more.</p>
          <p>I have learned an incredible amount from working on this project:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using Azure for server side APIs</li>
            <li>Working with a team of up to 10 people from four continents</li>
            <li>Having to stick to someone else's design: when working on solo projects or in pairs, it's really easy to fall back on "if at first you don't succeed, redefine success".  When you have to stick to a design, you just have to figure out the hard stuff.</li>
            <li>Integrating SDKs: This project uses many, and sometimes they fight...</li>
            <li>How to make orienteering maps!</li>
          </ul>
