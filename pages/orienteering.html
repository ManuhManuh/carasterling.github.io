          <p class="lead">This is a VR experience, brought to you by VentR-out, that is meant to "Extend the Outdoors". It features orienteer racing with a map and compass, alone or as a team.  The racing locations are replicas of real life parks, using older courses created by master map makers</p>
          <p>I was originally contracted to take care of the backend stuff, specifically PlayFab and Azure, and have moved into a lead developer position.</p>
          <p>I have learned an incredible amount from working on this project:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using Azure for server side APIs and addressables</li>
            <li>Integrating SDKs: This project uses many, and sometimes they fight...</li>
            <li>Multiplayer: This project is fully multiplayer, but also has to work where there is limited or no connectivity (particularly when demonstrating at events)</li>
            <li>Scaling UI: Racers use maps that have a specified scale and are accurate to the terrain (render camera used for player position).  This was more challenging than it might seem.</li>
            <li>Working with a team of up to 10 people from four continents</li>
            <li>Sticking to someone else's design: when working on solo projects or in pairs, it's really easy to fall back on "if at first you don't succeed, redefine success".  When you have to stick to a design, you just have to figure out the hard stuff.</li>
            <li>Adaptability: As the focus for the project changed (from game to simulation) some beloved things got dropped, and some cool new ones emerged</li>
          </ul>
