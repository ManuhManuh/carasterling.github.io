          <p class="lead">Throw office supplies at the ever complaining CyberBoss until he self-destructs! </p>
          <p>This is from a class assignment where we had to use the various skills we had learned up to that point: interaction, locomotion, animation, particle systems, etc.</p>
          <p>This was a great opportunity to give context to the individual skills we had learned and get them to work together.  I definitely got schooled in physics and collisions while doing this project (mainly with the EZ button and with keeping the CyberBoss from having sunken feet), and had a ton of fun with the voice overs!</p>
