          <p class="lead">This is a game that I started as part of the Unity tutorial for pillars of OOP programming. </p>
          <p>I liked how it turned out, so I made it into a full fledged game! Built for PC, Android and iOS.</p>
          <p>This project provided some serious learning opportunities, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Encapsulation: used properties rather than public variables</li>
            <li>Abstraction: each method basically only does one thing, and calls helper methods if required</li>
            <li>Inheritance: Different types of eggs and food inherit from base classes</li>
            <li>Polymorphism: Eggs override the Hatch method with their own brand of hatching (actual hatching art not yet implemented, but code structure is there)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I purchased the chicken asset (with its animations) but made the rest</p>
          <p>There are not nearly as many chicken jokes as I would have liked - if anyone knows any more I could add to this, please send using my contact information on the home page!</p>
          <p>Look for a web version coming soon!</p>
