          <p class="lead">This is the first chapter of what is intended to be a longer VR escape room adventure involving a very special wine recipe. </p>
          <p>I wanted to have something polished enough to publish, in a size that could be reasonably accomplished alone; extra chapters can be added, now that gameplay and interactions are already established.</p>
          <p>This project provided some serious learning opportunities, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Upgrading to XR Interaction Toolkit after coding interactions from scratch: this was NOT a trivial activity, and it taught me much about proper encapsulation</li>
            <li>Lighting: As a theatre tech, getting the lighting right was important to me; this project taught me the importance of light probes, reflection probes and mixed lighting, as well as presenting the opportunity to learn how to light additively loaded scenes.</li>
            <li>Asset management: The assets are a combination of third party assets, assets I created in Unity, and assets I created in Blender. Getting them all to work together taught me about how important having the proper art pipeline can be</li>
            <li>Custom shader: I used HLSL to create a shader to "reveal" the wine bottles, so they can be found if they roll under something</li>
          </ul>
