          <p class="lead">This is a modification of Unity's Tower Defense game, that now features Tuna Turner as a Tank and Chick Norris as a Super Tower!</p>
          <p>This was a group project with two other people; my contributions were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Added the code to allow for conditional waves (enemies that only spawn with high score)</li>
            <li>Did the necessary adjustments so the UI and levels worked correctly with the new agents</li>
            <li>Built a demo level to showcase the new characters without having to achieve a high score (which was the intended placement of the new characters)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This project was a great learning opportunity! We were tasked with adding a feature to an existing game, and it happened to be missing half the documentation.  Thankfully, the code base was good (logical naming and organization) so it was possible to figure out what we needed to do to allow Tuna and Chick to infiltrate!</p>
